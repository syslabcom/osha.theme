The existing seven pictograms are to be replaced with nine.</p><p>The key dates are: 1 December 2010, when substances must be reclassified and labelled in line with the new global system (GHS); and 1 June 2015, when the same process will be applied to mixtures (formerly called preparations).</p><p>Napo is involved in a series of short sketches working with chemicals, including those that are irritants, flammable, corrosive, toxic or a danger to the environment.

msgid "description_napo_film_13"
msgstr "<p>The film raises awareness of the dangers of exposing the skin to harmful (and sometimes not so harmful) substances, the situations where exposures occur, and what can be done to avoid risks, protect the skin and prevent damage. Napo discovers many different situations where exposure to chemicals and other substances can cause skin problems. He learns about the amazing qualities of the skin, and strips naked to show the audience: ‘Everything you always wanted to know about... your skin’. He identifies measures to prevent problems and has three important messages: Avoid – Protect – Check.</p><p>Avoiding or minimising contact with chemicals is achieved through elimination - using a mechanical method instead of a chemical one; by substitution - using a safer alternative; and by employing a safe working distance - using tools rather than handling directly. Personal protective equipment (PPE) is designed to protect the skin but Napo reminds us of the importance of taking care of the skin by showing prompt removal of contamination, washing skin properly, drying skin thoroughly and applying skin creams regularly.Finally Napo recommends regular checks for early signs of skin problems. </p>"
